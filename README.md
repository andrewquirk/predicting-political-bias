# CS224U (Natural Language Understanding) Final Project

The goal was to provide an easy and reasonable metric for the political bias of an article, in order to provide some context for the average reader to consider when consuming media. We created word embeddings using transcripts from Congressional speeches as a training set and tested on popular news articles.  We found that biases with sources like Breitbart and CNN were confirmed, but also that articles about certain topics tend to have political bias (i.e. articles about 'Food' are usually classified as Democrat and articles about 'Money' are classified as Republican).
